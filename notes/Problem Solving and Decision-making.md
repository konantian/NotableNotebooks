# Problem Solving and Decision-making

### Heuristics
  * From Greek word "find" or "discover"
  * Any practical problem solving method
  * Solution to simplified problem
  
 
### Heuristic vs Exact
  * Exact solution, exhausive analysis, precise theory
  * We rely on heuristics all the time
  * Heuristic decision-making and exact methods are both used in computer programs
