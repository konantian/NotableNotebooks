**[Functional Programming and Introduction to Lisp](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~mmueller/courses/325-Winter-2019/slides/LispIntro.pdf)**

## Lambda Calculus
 * Formal system for expressing computation
 * Main concepts: function abstraction, function application, variable binding, substitution
 * Equivalent in expressive power to Truing machines
 * A minimalistic, theoretical basis for functional programming
 
## LISP History
  * LISP: stands for LISt Processor
  * Developed by John McCarthy in 1958
  * second-oldest language in widespread use tody
  
## Scheme
  * Major dialect of Lisp, different from Common lisp
  * Used e.g. in GIMP graphics editor, Final Fantasy, Google APP Inventor
  * Often used as a scripting language for extending programs
  

## Clojure
  * Lisp dialect based on Common lisp
  * Focus on multithreaded programming,immutable datq
  * Runs on the Java virtual machine
  * Adds a **type system**
  
## Haskell
  * Pure functional language - no side effects
  * Strong static type(unlike lisp)
  * Lazy evaluation

## Lisp
  * Interpreted language
  * Case insensitive
  * Uses a read-eval-print loop
