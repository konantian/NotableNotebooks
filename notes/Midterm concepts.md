# Midterm concepts

## Logic
> Logic is the study of (i) criteria for distinguishing successful from unsuccessful argument, (ii) methods for applying those criteria, and (iii) related properties of statements such as implication, equivalence, logical truth, consistency, etc.

## Statment
> A statement is a declarative sentence; a sentence that attempts to state a fact-as opposed to a question, a command, an exclamation.

## Truth Value
> The truth value of a statement is just its truth or falsehood. At this point we make the assumption that every statement is either true or false but not both. The truth value of a given statement is fixed whether or not we know what that truth value is.

## Argument,Premise, Conclusion
> An argument is a finite set of statements, some of which - the premises - are supposed to support, or give reasons for, the remaining statement- the conclusion.

## Deductive Validity
> An argument(form) is deductively valid if and only if it is Not possible for All the premises to be true And the conclusion false. An argument is deductively invalid if and only if it is not valid.

## Soundness
> An argument is sound if and only if it is deductively valid And all its premises are true.

## Inductive Strength
> An argument is inductively strong to the degree to which the premises provide evidence to make the truth of the conclusion plausible or probable. If an argument is not strong, it is weak.

## Cogency
> An argument is cogent if and only if it is inductively strong And all the premises are true.

## Logically True

> A statement is logically true if and only if it is not possible for the statement to be false. Such statements are sometimes called tautologies.

## Logically False
> A statement is logically false if and only if it is not possible for the statement to be true. Such statements are sometimes called self-contradictions.

## Logically Contingent
> A statement is logically contingent if and only if it is neither logically true nor logically false;i.e.,it is both possible for the statement to be true, and possible for the statement to be false

## Logically Equivalent
> A pair of statements is logically equivalent if and only if it is not possible for the statements to have different truth values.

## Logically Contradictory
> A pair of statements is logically contradictory if and only if it is not possible for the statements to have the same truth values.

## Logically Inconsistent
> A set of statements is logically inconsistent if and only if it is not possible for all the statements to be true.

## Logically Entails
> A set of statements is logically entails a target statement if and only if it is Not possible for every member of the set to be true And the target statement false. we also say that the target statement logically follow from the set.

## Simple Sentence
> A simple sentence is a sentence that contains one subject and one predicate

## Compound Sentence
> A compound sentence is a sentence that either contains one or more simple sentences and at lease one compounding phrase, or contains a compound subject or compound predicate.

## Truth-Functional Compound
> A sentence is a truth-functionaly compound iff the truth value of the compound sentence is completely and uniquely determined by the truth values of the simple component sentences. Otherwise, the compound sentence is non-truth-functional.

## Truth-Functional Logic
> Truth-functionaly logic is the logic of truth-functional combinations of simple sentence. It investigates the properties that arguments, sentences, and sets of sentences have in virtue of their truth-functional structure.

## Truth Value Assignment
> A truth value assignment is an assignment of the value true or the value false, but not both, to each of the atomic wffs of S.A truth value assignment is a function from the set of atomic wffs into the set {T,F}.

## Truth-Functionally True
> A wff P of S is truth-functionally true iff P is true on every truth value assignment.

## Truth-Functinally False
> A wff P of S is truth-functionally false iff P is false on every truth value assignment.

## Truth-Functinally Contingent
> A wff P of S is truth-functionally contingent iff P is neither truth-functionally true nor truth-functionlly false.

## Truth-Functionally Satisfiable
> A wff P of S is truth-functionally satisfiable iff P is not truth-functionally false.

## Truth-Functionally Falsifiable
> A wff P of S is truth-functionally falsifiable iff P is not truth-functionally true.

## Truth-Functionally Equivalent
> Wffs P and Q of S are truth-functionally equivalent iff there is no truth value assignment on which they differ in truth value.

## Truth-Functionally Contradictory
> Wffs P and Q of S are truth-functionally contradictory iff there is no truth value assignment on which they have the same truth value.

## Truth-Functionally Consistent
> A set of wffs of S is truth-functionally consistent iff there is at least one truth value assignment on which all members of set are true.

## Truth-Functionally Valid
> An argument of S is truth-functionally valid iff there is no truth value assignment on which all the premises are true and the conclusion is false.
