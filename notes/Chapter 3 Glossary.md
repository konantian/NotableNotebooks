# Chapter 3 Glossary

## Truth table
`A truth table for a wff or set of wffs is a structure that lists the wff or wffs, all relevant truth value assignments, and the truth value of each wff on each truth value assignment`

## Truth Value Assignment
`A truth value assignment(or tva) is an assignment of the value true or the value false, but not both, to each of the atomic wffs of S.A truth value assignment is a function from the set of atomic wffs into the set{T, F}.`

## Truth-Functionally Consistent Set of Wffs
`A set of wffs of S is truth-functionally consistent iff there is at least one truth value assignment on which all members of set are true.`
  * Truth table test: A set of wffs is T-Fly consistent iff, in the set's joint truth table, there is at least one row in which all the members of set have a T under their main connectives. Set is T-Fly inconsistent iff there is no such row
  
## Truth-Functionally Contingent Wff
`A wff P of S is truth-functionally contingent iff P is neither truth-functionally true nor truth-functionally false; i.e., iff it is false on at least one truth value assignment and true on at least one truth value assignment`
  * Truth table test: P is T-Fly contingent iff, in its truth table, at least one F and at least one T appear in the column under the main connective.
  
## Truth-Functionally Contradictory Pair of Wffs
`Wffs P and Q of S are truth-functionally contradictory iff there is no truth value assignment on which they have the same truth value`
  * Truth table test: Wffs P and Q are T-Fly contradictory iff, in their joint truth table, there is no row in which the values under their main connectives are the same.
  
## Truth-Functionally Equivalent Pair of Wffs
`Wffs P and Q of S are truth-functionally equivalent iff there is no truth value assignment on which they differ in truth value`
  * Truth table test: Wffs P and Q are T-Fly equivalent iff, in their joint truth table, there is no row in which the values under their main connectives differ.
  
## Truth-Functionally False Wff
`A wff P of S is truth-functionally false iff P is false on every truth value assignment`
  * Truth table test: P is T-Fly false iff, in its truth table, only Fs appear in the column under the main connective.
  
## Truth-Functionally True Wff
`A wff P of S is truth-functionally true iff P is true on every truth value assignment`
  * Truth table test: P is T-Fly true iff, in its truth table, only Ts appear in the column under the main connective.
