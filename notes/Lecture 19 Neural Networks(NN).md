# Lecture 19 Neural Networks(NN)
## Neural Networks
### Definition:
  * A neural network in computing science is a function. 
  * It takes input(s) and produces output(s).
  * It has many parameters(weights) which are determined by learning(training).
  * Deep neural networks can approximate(almost) any function in practice
  * Training NN:
    * Supervised learning
    * Reinforcement learning

### Neural network in computing science
  * Massively simplified, abstract model
  * Used as a powerful function approximator for(almost) arbitrary functions
  * Connections between neurons:
    * Each connection has a weight
    * Expresses the strength of the connection
