# Chapter 1 Glossary

### Statement
`A statement is a declarative sentence; a sentence that attempts to state a fact-as opposed to a question, a command, an exclamation.`

### Argument
`An argument is a set of statements, some of which - premises - are supposed to support, or give reasons for, the remaining statement - the conclusion.`

### Deductive Validity
`An argument is deductively valid if and only if it is NOT possible for ALL the premises to be true AND the conclusion false. An argument is deductively invalid if and only if it is not valid.`

### Soundness
`An argument is sound if and only if it is deductively valid AND all its premises are true.`

### Counterexample
`A counterexample to an argument is an argument instance of exactly the same form having all true premises and a false conclusion. `

### Inductive strength
`An argument is inductively strong to the degree to which the premises provide evidence to make the truth of the conclusion plausible or probable.`

### Cogency
`An argument is cogent if and only if it is inductively strong AND all the premises are true.`

### Logically True
`A statement is logically true if and only if it is not possible for the statement to be false. Such statements are sometimes called tautologies.`

### Logically False
`A statement is logically false if and only if it is not possible for the statement to be true. Such statements are sometimes called self-contradictions.`

### Logically Contingent
`A statement is logically contingent if and only if it is neither logically true nor logically false;i.e.,it is both possible for the statement to be true, and possible for the statement to be false.`

### Logically Equivalent
`A pair of statements is logically equivalent if and only if it is not possible for the statements to have different truth values.`

### Logically Contradictory
`A pair of statements is logically contradictory if and only if it is not possible for the statements to have the same truth values.`

### Logically Inconsistent
`A set of statements is logically inconsistent if and only if it is not possible for all the statements to be true.`
