# Final concepts
### Logically True
> A statement is logically true if and only if it is not possible for the statement to be false. Such statements are sometimes called tautologies.

### Logically False
> A statement is logically false if and only if it is not possible for the statement to be true. Such statements are sometimes called self-contradictions.

### Logically Contingent
> A statement is logically contingent if and only if it is neither logically true nor logically false;i.e.

### Logically Equivalent
> A pair of statements is logically equivalent if and only if it is not possible for the statements to have different truth values.

### Logically Contradictory
> A pair of statements is logically contradictory if and only if it is not possible for the statements to have the same truth values.

### Logically Inconsistent
> A set of statements is logically inconsistent if and only if it is not possible for all the statements to be true.

### Logically Entails
> A set of statements is logically entails a target statement if and only if it is Not possible for every member of the set to be true And the target statement false. we also say that the target statement logically follow from the set.

### Simple Sentence
> A simple sentence is a sentence that contains one subject and one predicate

### Compound Sentence
> A compound sentence is a sentence that either contains one or more simple sentences and at lease one compounding phrase, or contains a compound subject or compound predicate.

### Truth-Functional Compound
> A sentence is a truth-functionaly compound iff the truth value of the compound sentence is completely and uniquely determined by the truth values of the simple component sentences. Otherwise, the compound sentence is non-truth-functional.

### Truth-Functionally True
> A wff $\mathbb{P}$ of S is truth-functionally true iff $\mathbb{P}$ is true on every truth value assignment.

### Truth-Functinally False
> A wff $\mathbb{P}$ of S is truth-functionally false iff $\mathbb{P}$ is false on every truth value assignment.

### Truth-Functinally Contingent
> A wff $\mathbb{P}$ of S is truth-functionally contingent iff $\mathbb{P}$ is neither truth-functionally true nor truth-functionlly false.

### Truth-Functionally Satisfiable
> A wff $\mathbb{P}$ of S is truth-functionally satisfiable iff $\mathbb{P}$ is not truth-functionally false.

### Truth-Functionally Falsifiable
> A wff $\mathbb{P}$ of S is truth-functionally falsifiable iff $\mathbb{P}$ is not truth-functionally true.

### Truth-Functionally Equivalent
> Wffs $\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ of S are truth-functionally equivalent iff there is no truth value assignment on which they differ in truth value.

### Truth-Functionally Contradictory
> Wffs $\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ of S are truth-functionally contradictory iff there is no truth value assignment on which they have the same truth value.

### Truth-Functionally Consistent
> A set $\Gamma$ of wffs of S is truth-functionally consistent iff there is at least one truth value assignment on which all members of $\Gamma$ are true.

### Truth-Functionally Valid
> An argument of S is truth-functionally valid iff there is no truth value assignment on which all the premises are true and the conclusion is false.

### Quantifier
> Where $\mathbb{x}$ ranges over individual variables, expressions of the form($\forall x$)are called universal quantifiers, while expressions of the form($\exist x$) are called existential quantifiers.

### Bound Variables,Free variable
> An occurrence of a variable $\mathbb{x}$ in a wff $\mathbb{P}$ is bound iff it is within the scope of an $\mathbb{x}$-quantifier. An occurrence of a variables is free iff it is not bound.

### Closed Wff,Sentence of P
> A wff of **_P_** is closed iff it contains no free occurrences of variables. We also call such wffs sentences of **_P_**.

### Open Wff
> A wff of **_P_** is open iff it contains at least one free occurrence of a variable. Otherwise it is a closed wff.

### Predicate
> A predicate is a series of words with one or more blanks that yields a sentence when all its blanks filled with singular terms.

### Quantificationally Consistent
> A set $\Gamma$of wffs of **_P_** is quantificationally consistent iff there is at least one interpretation on which all members of $\Gamma$ are true. We also say that $\Gamma$ has a model or is modeled. Set is quantificationally inconsistent iff it is not quantificationally consistent.

### Quantificationally Contingent
> A wff $\mathbb{P}$ of **_P_** is quantificationally contingent iff $\mathbb{P}$ is neither quantificationally true nor quantificationally false

### Quantificationally Contradictory Pair of Wffs
> Wffs $\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ of **_P_** are quantificationally contradictory iff there is no interpretation of which they have the same truth value.

### Quantificationally Entails
> A set $\Gamma$ of wffs of **_P_** quantificationally entails a wff $\mathbb{P}$ iff there is no interpretation on which all the members of $\Gamma$ are true and $\mathbb{P}$ is false.

### Quantificationally Equivalent Pair of Wffs
> Wffs $\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ of **_P_** are quantificationally equivalent iff there is no interpretation on which they differ in truth value.

### Quantificationally False Wff
> A wff $\mathbb{P}$ of **_P_** is quantificationally false iff $\mathbb{P}$ is false on every interpretation

### Quantificationally Falsifiable Wff
> A wff $\mathbb{P}$ of **_P_** is quantificationlly falsifiable iff $\mathbb{P}$ is not quantificationally true

### Quantificationally Satisfiable Wff
> A wff $\mathbb{P}$ of **_P_** is quantificationally satisfiable iff $\mathbb{P}$ is not quantificationally false.

### Quantificationally True Wff
> A wff $\mathbb{P}$ of **_P_** is quantificationally true iff $\mathbb{P}$ is true on every interpretation

### Quantificationally Valid Argument
> An argument of **_P_** is quantificationally valid iff there is no interpretation on which all the premises are true and the conclusion is false. An argument of **_P_** is quantificationally invalid iff it is not quantificationally valid.
