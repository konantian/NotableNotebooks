# Final concepts
### Bound Variables,Free variable
> An occurrence of a variable x in a wff P is bound iff it is within the scope of an x-quantifier. An occurrence of a variables is free iff it is not bound.

### Closed Wff,Sentence of P
> A wff of P is closed iff it contains no free occurrences of variables. We also call such wffs sentences of P.

### Expression of P
> An expression of P is any finite sequence of the symbols of P.

### Open Wff
> A wff of P is open iff it contains at least one free occurrence of a variables. Otherwise it is a closed wff.

### Predicate
> A predicate is a series of words with one or more blanks that yields a sentence when all its blanks filled with singular terms.

### Quantificational Logic
> Quantificatoinal Logic is the logic of sentences involving quantifiers, predicates, and names.It investigates the properties that arguments, sentences, and sets of sentences have in virture of their quantificational structure.

### Quantificationally Consistent
> A set $\Gamma$of wffs of P is quantificationally consistent iff there is at least one interpretation on which all members of $\Gamma$ are true. We also say that $\Gamma$ has a model or is modeled. Set is quantificationally inconsistent iff it is not quantificationally consistent.

### Quantificatinally Contingent
> A wff P of P is quantificationally contingent iff P is neither quantificationally true nor quantificationally false

### Quantificationally Contradictory Pair of Wffs
> Wffs P and Q of P are quantificationally contradictory iff there is no interpretation of which they have the same truth value.

### Quantificationally Entails
> A set $\Gamma$ of wffs of P quantificationally entails a wff P iff there is no interpretation on which all the members of $\Gamma$ are true and P is false.

### Quantificationally Equivalent Pair of Wffs
> Wffs P and Q of P are quantificationally equivalent iff there is no interpretation on which they differe in truth value.

### Quantificationally False Wff
> A wff P of P is quantificationally false iff P is false on every interpretation

### Quantificationally Falsifiable Wff
> A wff P of P is quantificationlly falsifiable iff P is not quantificationally true

### Quantificationally Satisfiable Wff
> A wff P of P is quantificationally satisfiable iff P is not quantificationally false.

### Quantificationally True Wff
> A wff P of P is quantificationally true iff P is true on every interpretation

### Quantificationally Valid Argument
> An argument of P is quantificationally valid iff there is no interpretation on which all the premises are true and the conclusion is false. An argument of P is quantificationally invalid iff it is not quantificationally valid.
