# Edges

**Edges**
  * Are image positions where local image intensity changes significantly along a particular orientation
  * Human visual system extracts sensitive information from edges
  * An entire image can be decently "reconstructed" from edges, so in that sense edges are the "information packets" in an image
  * Edge detection
    * A dominant approach in edge detection is **gradient-based**

**Image derivative**
 * Derivatives of image

 * Magnitude of image gradient is a good "edge indicator"

 * Sobel edge operator
   * The Sobelâ€“Feldman operator is based on convolving the image with a small, separable, and integer-valued filter in the horizontal and vertical directions and is therefore relatively **inexpensive** in terms of computations. 
   * On the other hand, the gradient approximation that it produces is relatively crude, in particular for high-frequency variations in the image.
